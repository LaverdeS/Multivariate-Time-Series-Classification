The purpose of this repo is to provide the tools for time-series data analysis and data preparation pipelines for machine learning applications and research with eye-tracking data: gaze and pupil dilation. The initial processing and transformation blocks enhance the researcher for rapid-prototyping data applications and first hand data cleaning and visualization. 

## :coffee: Getting Started

* Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. conda environment named 'ts-tools':

	`conda create ts-tools` <br />
	`conda activate ts-tools`

## :clap: Quick Tour

You can run this [Colab notebook](url) to run the examples below.

See the [documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured) for a full description
of the features in the library.
