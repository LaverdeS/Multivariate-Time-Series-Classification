Downloads to support API Hub service for Time Series Classification
The development team for the Time Series Classification service will provide sample materials to the public or IBM internal developers for use in understanding the function and parameter configuration of the service. These sample materials will initially be a jupyter notebook to exercise the API calls and a sample.csv file for users who want to exercise the API calls via the API Hub service GUI.
